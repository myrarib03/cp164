how the combine method works:

temp = source._top

^^this refers to the first node in memory of our source linked stack

source._top = source._top._next

^^this means we are making our new top into the next node in memory, however
our temp is still referring to the first node in memory (so it does not get deleted)

So, as we stand right now: temp = node1, source._top = node2

temp._next = self._top

^^this means that the next node in the case of our very first node in memory, is now the top of 
our self (which is none right now). this also helps us to cut off temp from source.
so, to summarize: temp = node1, temp.next = none

self._top = temp

^^this means that the first node in our memory is our new top, and it is pointing to none

so, to sumarize: self._top = node1, self._top._next = none, source.top = node2 (new node 1), source._top._next = node2._next

Marks on exams means CAN I MOVE NODES INSTEAD OF DATA???.
