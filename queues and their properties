Normal Queue:
front = [4,3,2,1] = end

Priority Queue:
front = [1,2,3,4] = end
if you want to switch the order to reverse it you could probably just 
do the object with least priority first as opposed to most priority.
to distinguish priority between values we use a < operator. 

Dequeue:
front = [4,3,2,1] = end
***but Dequeues are special with linked data structurs
because when they are linked they are capable of two pointers.
One pointer goes to the previous node, the other pointer 
goes to the next node. Dequeues are not organized based on
priority.
