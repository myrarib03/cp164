BST is_empty = a BST is empty when the root is None
BST_Height = the height of the children plus one (how far the node is from the
bottom of the tree). For any node with no children, the height is one.
any empty nodes have a height of zero.

BST_nodes = the children nodes are the values that are
either less than (left) or greater than (right) the root. 
BSTs are Non-linear data structures. 
They DO NOT have duplicates.
