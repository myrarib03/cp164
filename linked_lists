Linked lists notes:
1. MAKE SURE YOU CAN WRITE THE PRIORITY QUEUE INSERT FUNCTION.
MAKE SURE YOU CAN MASTER IT.

the difference between the algorithms for linked and array based is not huge.

Stack.peek():

we check if it is empty for array based by using is_empty. With linked versions we look
to see if their top is none or not. top is none when empty.

iterative algorithm = NON RECURSIVE.

should be very good at iterating through a linked structure using a current structure.
SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS IN MY SLEEP.

we cant implement binary search in a sorted linked list so we must do a linear search.
with a linked list we start at the first occurance of key instead of at the front of the list.

if you can program in the array based, you can program in the linked. as long as you
understand the key differences between them.
